# Alchemy University Ethereum Bootcamp Solutions 🚀

Hello everyone,

I'm excited to share with you my solutions to all the challenges from the Alchemy University Ethereum Bootcamp.
You can find the code for each challenge organized by week, topic, and challenge in this repository.

It's important to try to solve the challenges on your own first and only use the solutions if you're truly stuck.
Also, if you notice any issues with my solutions, please let me know and I'll do my best to address them.
